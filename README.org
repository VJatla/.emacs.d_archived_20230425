# Installation instructions
## Windows (Cygwin)
In windows by trail and error I found that emacs installed via
Cygwin has the least problems (if you do not have access to 
WSL, Windows Subsystem for Linux)
1. Install Cygwin follwing instructions at
    https://x.cygwin.com/docs/ug/setup.html#setup-cygwin-x-installing
2. While installing select emacs-X11.
3. Start `XWin Server`
4. From the system tray, x application menu, we can launch Emacs.
5. The tramp works with SSH at this stage. No need to use plinkx.
