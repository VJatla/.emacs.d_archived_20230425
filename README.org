* TRAMP in windows
To get tramp/Treemacs remote file access working in windows we need to
1. Add a local directory to treemacs projects before attempting to do
   remote connection.
2. Install putty via scoop
3. Install gow via scoop (<-- Is this necessary?)
4. Save putty sessions.
5. Connect to putty session by using,
   #+begin_src sh
     C://plink:emsaconed:/home/emsaconed/public_html/emsaconed.unm.edu
   #+end_src
   and hit enter. You will be asked for password
